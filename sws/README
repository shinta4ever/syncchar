Getting Started with MetaTM
---------------------------

MetaTM operates as a module for Virtutech Simics. Thus, the first step
is to download and install Simics. Simics requires a license, but free
academic licenses (personal and site) are available.

Once you have simics installed, download the MetaTM tarball and disk
image from here (coming soon).

Unpack the tarball, which should provide you with a top-level
directory labeled sws.

cd into this directory and run the following commands:

(simics installation directory)/bin/workspace-setup . --force
make

Once this has completed successfully, move the disk image into the sws
directory. At this point, you should be able to start a simulation
with the following command:

./s


Configuring Your Simulation
---------------------------

The parameters of the simulated machine can be changed by editing the
file osa-common.simics. Most importantly, the benchmarks to be
automatically executed after boot can be changed by editing the
@benchmarks array.


Compiling TxLinux
-----------------


One may download and compile TxLinux for oneself by downloading the
source tarball here (coming soon). The build process is identical to
Linux, except that there are menuconfig options to enable transactions
in various subsystems.
